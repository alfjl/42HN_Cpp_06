# 42_Cpp_Module_06

The goal of the **C++ modules 00 to 08** is to introduce the student to Object-Oriented Programming and the C++ programming language in general.
Because of the complexity of the language, the students code has to comply with the C++98 standard.

**C++ module 06** introduces the learner to the various concepts of type casting, such as upcast & downcast, static cast, dynamic cast, reinterpret cast and const cast, as well as cast operators.

## Description

ex00:  
Write a program that takes a string representation of a scalar type and convert it to it's actual type, than explicitly to the three other data types. You need to handle char, int, float and double.  
(conversion of scalar types)

ex01:  
Write a serialize() and a deserialize() function, converting a pointer to a struct to type uintptr_t and vice versa.  
(short intro to serialization of data types)

ex02:  
Implement a Base class and three inheriting classes A, B, C. Write a function that randomly instanciates A, B or C and returns it as a Base pointer. Write functions that print the actual type of a Base* or Base&, without using typeinfo header, or pointers in these functions.  
(first steps into identification of different objects and their type)

## Learnings

Going deeper into type casting, serialization of data and data type identification.
